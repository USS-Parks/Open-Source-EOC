# V1 Execution Ledger

Append-only unit receipts for the roster in
[`FINISH-PSPR-2026-09-22.md`](./FINISH-PSPR-2026-09-22.md), approved by Basho
on 2026-09-23. Never edit a prior receipt; corrections are new entries that
name the receipt they correct.

Receipts before this ledger opened are in the frozen
[`VEOC-EXECUTION-LEDGER.md`](./VEOC-EXECUTION-LEDGER.md), which holds
VEOC-00 through `W1.12`. Cite a receipt in either ledger by its heading, never
by line number.

## Receipt template

Every unit records, in this order:

- what the unit changed, in plain language, with the files it owned;
- the decision defaults it applied from the plan's section 7, and any
  deviation from the plan's own wording, stated as a deviation;
- schema, contract and dependency changes with licenses;
- exact verification commands, counts and results, with red reported as red;
- the evidence level: unit, integration, browser, real-database, or document;
- deferred work, blockers and the rollback path;
- the commit, and the statement that no push was performed unless Basho
  instructed one.

## V1 W1.13: freeze the historical ledger and open this one

- **Frozen:** `VEOC-EXECUTION-LEDGER.md` carries a notice at the top marking it
  closed and historical, pointing here for later receipts. No receipt in it was
  rewritten, reordered or moved.
- **Deviation from the plan, recorded.** The unit's acceptance in the roster
  reads "no receipt is rewritten or moved, and the new ledger opens with
  `W1.11`". Those two clauses contradict each other: `W1.11` ran first under
  the plan's own execution order, so its receipt, and those of `W1.9`, `W1.10`
  and `W1.12`, were already in the historical ledger. Honoring the binding
  clause, no receipt moved, so this ledger opens with `W1.13` instead. The
  roster row is corrected to say so.
- **Line citations retired.** The freeze notice pushed every line in the
  historical ledger down by ten, which would have silently falsified the five
  line-number citations pointing into it. The two in the live roster are now
  by receipt heading: the `W1.8` migration receipt and the partial VEOC-79D
  exercise receipt. The three in the archived V1 roster are left as they were,
  because that document is historical and is not executed. The freeze notice
  states the ten-line offset so an old citation can still be resolved.
- **Pointers updated:** `docs/README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` name this ledger as
  the destination for receipts and the historical one as frozen.
- **Verification:** the link checker passed all 69 tracked Markdown files.
- **Evidence level:** document.
- **Result:** W1.13 is complete. Committed with this receipt. No push
  performed. Next: W1.14, consolidate the server test suite.
